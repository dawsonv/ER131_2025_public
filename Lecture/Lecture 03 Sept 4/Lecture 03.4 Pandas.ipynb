    "In Data8 you used the `tables` library to organize and manipulate data.  I've not used tables but it has been described to me as a 'light' version of pandas.  So this will be somewhat familiar to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has several features that make it immediately better than numpy for organizing data.\n",
    "1. You can have different data types (string, int, float) in each column\n",
    "2. You can label columns (headers)\n",
    "3. You can label rows (index)\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the data structure that holds all these things together a **data frame**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ambiguity alert**: up to now we've talked about indexing to access individual elements of a data structure.  The index in pandas has a slightly more specific meaning, in that it references the rows of the data frame.  Pandas documentation talks about \"location\" or \"position\" in place using \"index\" as we did with the other data structures.  I'll try my best to disambiguate, but also rely on context to clarify the meaning of the terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the data frame structure is what draws us to use pandas.  But it also has a bunch of great built-in functions you can use to manipulate data once it is loaded in."
